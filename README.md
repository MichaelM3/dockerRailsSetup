# dockerRailsSetup
My first attempt at writing a super simple shell script, that creates a directory with a dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, gemfile, gemfile.lock for when starting a rails docker project
THE DIRECTORY WHERE THE RAILS PROJECT IS LOCATED IS BASED ON MY SETUP. CHANGE THE DIRECTORY TO WHERE YOU KEEP YOUR WORK
